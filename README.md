# Marketflash_mini_project
## About
Marketflash is a new, small markteing company owned by Markus
## To do
Markus would like me to build a functional ER diagram for the database, expressing the data types, constraints and their relationships.
He also would like me to create a code for creating and testing the Database. Including the table creation, 5 entries to each table and JOIN statements for testing that the tables can be joined for querying.
A tableau dashboard is also a key requirements showing all the important KPI's.
